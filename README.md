# Getting Started with Clinic ReactJs App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## System Requirements
### Node.js

1. First make sure your machine is running Node.js:
  
Open a terminal or command prompt and verify the installation by running the following command:
  ```
  node -v
  ```
This command will display the installed Node.js version. 

2. If you don't have Node.js visit the official website at https://nodejs.org.

On the Node.js website, you will see two versions available for download: LTS (Long-Term Support) and Current. It is recommended to download the LTS version for stability unless you specifically require features from the Current version.

Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system. Node.js is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Click on the download link for your desired version and operating system.

Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the installation wizard instructions. You may need administrative privileges to install Node.js on your machine.

During the installation, you can choose the installation directory and other options according to your preferences. In most cases, the default options should work fine.

After the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and verify the installation by running the following command:

  ```
  node -v
  ```
### yarn
1. First make sure your machine is running `yarn`:
  
Open a terminal or command prompt and verify the installation by running the following command:
  ```
yarn --version
  ```
This command will display the installed Yarn version.

2. If you don't have yarn visit the official website at https://yarnpkg.com.

On the Yarn website, you'll find installation instructions for different operating systems. Choose the appropriate installation method based on your operating system.

After the installation is complete, open a new terminal or command prompt window and verify the installation by running the following command:
 ```
yarn --version
  ```

## Installation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and clone the repository to your machine:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/rexy09/clinic_frontend.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Install project dependencies by running the following command:
  ```
  yarn install
  ```
This will download and install all the required packages specified in the package.json file.

4. Once the installation is complete, start the development server with the following command:
 ```
 yarn start
  ```
This will start the React development server and launch your project in a web browser. The development server automatically watches for changes to your code and updates the browser accordingly.
